AI model (CNN)  using tensorflow


Project Overview Our project aims to develop an automated system for detecting and grading Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) from high-resolution retinal images. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, we strive to provide a reliable and efficient tool that assists healthcare professionals in the early detection and timely treatment of DR. Our model classifies each image into two categories: "Diabetic Retinopathy" (DR) and "No Diabetic Retinopathy" (NDR), ensuring accurate and consistent results. Additionally, we have developed a user-friendly frontend to enhance the user experience for medical professionals, making the screening process more accessible and efficient.
